## Deprecation notice

Contentful will stop supporting the ContentfulManagementAPI SDK **JULY 13, 2018**. The source code will still be available, but feature and support requests will no longer be addressed. If you must take advantage of a feature from the Content Management API, or fix a bug, it is recommended that you either fork the codebase (now at [contentful.objc/tree/master/ManagementAPI](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.objc/tree/master/ManagementAPI)), or implement API interaction your own.

Additionally, the source code and documentation has been moved to a new Github repository. Please visit [contentful.objc](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.objc/blob/master/mgmt-README.md).

In order to continue using the ContentfulManagementAPI pod, please ensure your Podfile only has the following line.

```ruby
pod 'ContentfulManagementAPI'
```
